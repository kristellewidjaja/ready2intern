# Design Agent Workflow – Design Document

## Architecture Overview

This workflow implements an orchestrated process with modular task architecture that transforms project documents into enterprise-grade specification packages through systematic progression across multiple stages.

Each stage has focused objectives and clear quality gates, progressing from initial session management through requirements generation, dual-path architecture design, holistic quality assessment, comprehensive security evaluation, and final output organization.

## Modular Task Architecture

The workflow is organized into focused, modular task files for better organization and clarity:

- **Stage 0: Session Management Module** – Execution modes, handoff protocols, and session recovery
- **Stage 1: Project Analysis Module** – Project complexity assessment and workflow recommendations
- **Stage 2: Requirements Generation Module** – Input assessment and requirements package generation
- **Stage 3: Architecture Generation Module** – Dual-path architecture design with Intelligence Hub integration
- **Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment Module** – Comprehensive quality evaluation and iterative improvement
- **Stage 5: Security Assessment Module** – Threat modeling and security controls integration
- **Stage 6: Documentation Generation Module** – MCP prescriptive guidance and executive summary generation
- **Stage 7: Output Organization Module** – Project folder structure and deliverable organization requirements
- **Stage 8+: Feedback Integration Module** - Stakeholder feedback analysis and iterative improvement task generation

## Enhanced Project Input System Architecture

### Input Category Framework

The input system processes project materials in two distinct phases to maintain proper separation between requirements and architecture concerns.

## Requirements Generation Phase (Stage 2)

Processes three categories of project materials to establish pure business-driven requirements:

#### Category 1: Project Context (`project-doc/project-context/`)
**Purpose**: Project-specific requirements, business context, and stakeholder needs
**Processing Logic**:
- Extract core business objectives and functional requirements
- Identify user personas, workflows, and success criteria
- Document project-specific constraints and technical preferences
- Generate primary functional and non-functional requirements
**Output**: Core project requirements that define "what we're building"

#### Category 2: Technical Knowledge (`project-doc/technical-knowledge/`)
**Purpose**: External reference materials and system integration specifications
**Processing Logic**:
- Analyze external API documentation without treating as build targets
- Extract integration patterns, data formats, and authentication requirements
- Identify service limits, rate limits, and compatibility constraints
- Document how external systems influence architecture
**Output**: Integration requirements that define "what we're integrating with"

#### Category 3: Organization Context (`project-doc/organization-context/`)
**Purpose**: Company policies, standards, and organizational constraints
**Processing Logic**:
- Extract naming conventions, tagging strategies, and resource patterns
- Apply security policies, compliance requirements, and budget constraints
- Enforce organizational standards across all architecture decisions
- Validate against company-specific requirements (MAP credits, cost allocation)
**Output**: Organization constraints that define "how we must build"

## Architecture Generation Phase (Stage 3)

Incorporates reference system analysis to inform architecture decisions:

#### Project Code Analysis (from Stage 1 output)
**Purpose**: Existing codebases and reference system analysis
**Processing Logic**:
- Use comprehensive codebase analysis from Stage 1 (stored in `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/`)
- Identify reusable components and integration opportunities
- Document existing system dependencies and integration requirements
- Generate integration strategies and compatibility requirements
**Output**: Reference system considerations that inform “how we can leverage existing assets”

### Context Separation Engine

**Classification Logic**:
- Folder-based automatic categorization prevents content misinterpretation
- Clear boundaries between project scope and external dependencies
- Organizational constraints applied consistently across all decisions
- Reference system analysis separated from requirements generation

**Traceability Framework**:
- Requirements linked to specific input categories and source documents (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context only)
- Architecture decisions traced to requirements plus reference system analysis
- Compliance documentation showing organizational policy application
- Integration specifications clearly separated from build requirements

### Processing Workflow Integration

**Stage 0-1 Integration**: Input discovery, categorization, and project-code analysis during session management and project analysis  
**Stage 2 Integration**: Three-category processing during requirements generation (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context)
**Stage 3 Integration**: Requirements-driven architecture generation informed by reference system analysis from Stage 1
**Stage 4–7 Integration**: Category-specific validation during quality assessment and final documentation
