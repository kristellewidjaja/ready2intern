# Design Agent Workflow – Requirements

## Purpose

Transform project documents into implementation-ready specification packages through a systematic, quality-driven workflow that ensures enterprise-grade standards and comprehensive security assessment.

## Business Problem

Traditional specification development suffers from:
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Teams proceed with poorly structured requirements, causing implementation delays
- **Poor Design Quality**: Specifications lack depth, contain inconsistencies, fail enterprise standards
- **Security Gaps**: Security considerations added as afterthought, leading to vulnerabilities
- **Quality Inconsistency**: No systematic approach to ensure implementation readiness

## Solution Approach

### Orchestrated Workflow with Modular Architecture

The workflow transforms project documents into enterprise-grade specification packages through systematic progression from context capture to final delivery:

**Stage 0: Session Management**
– Execution mode detection (new session, continuation, recovery)
– Customer context capture (project goals, technical preferences, organizational context)
– Workflow state initialization and context source establishment
– Handoff protocols for seamless workflow progression

**Stage 1: Project Analysis**
– Assess project complexity and provide workflow recommendations
– Analyze document count, size, and types to determine execution strategy
– Provide time estimates and session management guidance
– Document project characteristics for context-aware execution

**Stage 2: Requirements Generation**
– Conduct comprehensive three-category input assessment analysis across project-context, technical-knowledge, and organization-context folders
– Extract integration requirements from external reference materials without misinterpreting them as build targets
- Apply organizational policies and standards as architectural constraints
– Transform project-specific context into structured requirements packages based purely on business needs
– Generate functional/non-functional requirements with category-specific traceability matrix
– Establish foundation for architecture design with clear separation of concerns
– Maintain requirements purity without influence from existing code patterns

**Stage 3: Architecture Generation**
- **Dual-Path Approach**: Intelligence Hub integration (Path A) or Standard generation (Path B)
- **Path A**: Expert-guided architecture with deep research option (15 min standard / 60 min deep)
- **Path B**: Systematic generation with reference architecture analysis and context-aware modes
- **Reference System Integration**: Incorporate project-code analysis from Stage 1 to inform architecture decisions
- Document architecture decisions with rationale and alternatives
- Balance requirements-driven design with existing system integration opportunities
- Comprehensive architecture integration validation with service limits assessment

**Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment**
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment across all domains (requirements + architecture together)
- Numerical scoring (0–100) with mandatory 90/100 threshold
- Iterative refinement optimizing requirements and architecture holistically
- Complete audit trail with score sheets for each iteration

**Stage 5: Security Assessment**
- AWS-compliant security threat modeling using STRIDE methodology
- Comprehensive security controls mapping and mitigation strategies
- Integration with specification package for complete security posture
- Security testing framework with concrete test cases

**Stage 6: Documentation Generation**
- Tools prescriptive guidance generation with comprehensive MCP servers and Skills inventory
- Project-specific MCP and Skills recommendations with implementation guidance
- Executive summary creation synthesizing final specification package
- Stakeholder communication materials and implementation readiness assessment

**Stage 7: Output Organization**
- Project folder structure validation and organization
- Iterative content management with proper file naming
- Specialized content organization (threat model, supplement material, executive summary)
- Final handoff preparation with comprehensive documentation

**Stage 8+: Feedback Integration (Iterative)**
- Stakeholder feedback collection and analysis from `project-doc/feedback/iteration-N/` folders
- Dynamic improvement task generation based on feedback content and scope
- Complete project folder regeneration with new iteration folders (project-name-iteration-N)
- Regeneration of all deliverables: specification-package, score-sheet, executive-summary, threat-model, supplement-material
- Changelog creation documenting changes from previous iteration
- Continuous quality improvement through stakeholder-driven enhancements
- Support for unlimited feedback cycles with proper task numbering and traceability

## Key Capabilities

### Organized Output Management
- **Single Project Folder**: All deliverables organized in one project folder with structured layout
- **Iteration Management**: Sequential specification packages (iteration-1, iteration-2, etc.)
- **Score Sheet Organization**: All assessment score sheets in project root with clear numbering
- **Threat Model Integration**: Dedicated folder for comprehensive security assessment
- **Supporting Documentation**: Organized supplement material including input assessment analysis

### Enhanced Input Assessment Analysis
- **Three-Category Requirements Processing**: Systematic analysis across three distinct requirements categories (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context)
- **Context Classification**: Automatic distinction between “what we’re building” vs “what we’re integrating with” vs “organizational constraints”
- **Technical Knowledge Integration**: Analysis of external reference materials to extract integration requirements without misinterpreting them as build targets
- **Organizational Policy Application**: Automatic application of company standards, naming conventions, and compliance requirements across all architecture decisions
- **Project Context Extraction**: Business, technical, and user context extraction from project-specific materials
- **Gap Identification**: Category-specific identification of missing information and constraints
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Complete stakeholder analysis with requirements categorization
- **Generation Readiness**: Requirements assessment of readiness to proceed with specification generation
- **Reference System Separatism**: Legacy system analysis handled separately in Stage 1 to avoid biasing requirements

## Iterative Feedback Integration
- **Stakeholder Feedback Processing**: Systematic analysis of feedback documents from multiple stakeholder types (business, technical, security, operational)
- **Change Detection Engine**: Content fingerprinting using SHA-256 hashing to identify new, modified, and unchanged inputs for incremental processing
- **Conflict Detection System**: Semantic analysis to identify contradictions between new feedback and existing decisions with automated conflict categorization
- **User-Guided Conflict Resolution**: Interactive resolution workflow with conflict reports, resolution options, and impact analysis
- **Incremental Processing**: Selective analysis of only changed inputs with cached result reuse for efficiency (target: <50% of full regeneration time)
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: Automatic generation of improvement tasks based on feedback content and scope, following coding agent's Task 1 pattern
- **Feedback Categorization**: Classification of feedback into requirements changes, architecture modifications, security enhancements, and quality improvements
- **Intelligent Specification Merging**: Update existing specifications while preserving approved decisions with change annotations
- **Iteration Management**: Support for unlimited feedback cycles with proper task numbering (Task 8, 9, 10+) and complete project folder iterations
- **Traceability Maintenance**: Complete audit trail linking feedback documents to generated improvement tasks and specification changes
