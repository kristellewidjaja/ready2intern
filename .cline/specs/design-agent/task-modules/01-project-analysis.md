# Stage 1: Project Analysis

## Overview
**Objective**: Assess project complexity and provide workflow recommendations  
**Dependencies**: Input sources (project documents, user context, images, or combination)

This stage provides the foundation for the entire workflow by analyzing project complexity and recommending appropriate execution strategies.

## Task 1.1: Assess Project Complexity

**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Input sources (project documents, user context, images, or combination)

**Description**: Analyze available input sources to assess project complexity and provide workflow recommendations

**Required Deliverables**: Complexity assessment documented in `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md` with recommendations

**File Structure Reference**: See main [tasks.md](../tasks.md) "File Structure & Storage Locations" section for complete storage location definitions

---

### Key Activities

- **Input Source Analysis**: Analyze available input sources (documents, user context, images)
- **Code Project Detection and Ingestion**: Detect and ingest any code projects from `project-doc/` folder
- **Complexity Categorization**: Determine if project is Simple/Moderate/Complex based on:
  - **Start from scratch**: User context only (images, descriptions) → Simple  
  - **Simple documents**: 1–3 files, mostly text/markdown, <5MB total → Simple  
  - **Moderate documents**: 4–8 files or mixed formats or 5–15MB total → Moderate  
  - **Complex documents**: >8 files or large PDFs/Presentations or >15MB total → Complex  
- **Time Estimation**: Provide realistic time estimate based on complexity  
- **Workflow Recommendations**: Suggest single task vs full workflow approach  
- **Session Guidance**: Recommend break points and session management strategies  

---

## Complexity Assessment Framework

### Simple Projects

- **Characteristics**: Start from scratch (user context only) or 1–3 files, mostly text/markdown, <5MB total  
- **Time Estimation**: 2–3 hours total workflow time  
- **Session Strategy**: Auto-proceed with full workflow  
- **Examples**: POC from image description, small text-based requirements, basic project concepts  

---

### Moderate Projects

- **Characteristics**: 4–8 files or mixed formats or 5–15MB total  
- **Time Estimation**: 4–6 hours total workflow  
- **Session Strategy**: Ask user preference (single task vs full workflow)  

---

### Complex Projects
- **Characteristics**: 9+ files or large PDFs/presentations or >15MB total  
- **Time Estimate**: 6+ hours total workflow time  
- **Recommendation**: Strongly recommend single task approach  
- **Session Strategy**: Execute one task per session to avoid timeouts  

---

## Assessment Process

### 1. **Input Source Inventory**

- **Check `project-doc/` folder**: Count files, calculate total size, identify file types (if folder exists and contains files)
- **Review `.workflow-state/customer-context.md`**: Analyze captured user context from session management
- **Analyze current user prompt**: Extract additional context, images, requirements from current request
- **Identify input scenario**: Existing documents, start from scratch, mixed, or insufficient

---

### 2. **Code Project Detection and Ingestion**  
*(Execute when `project-doc/project-code/` folder exists and is not empty)*

- **Check for Code Projects**: Verify if `project-doc/project-code/` folder exists and contains files
- **If folder exists and is not empty**: Proceed with detection and ingestion
- **If folder is empty or doesn't exist**: Skip this step and document in handoff

#### Scan Code Sources  
Look for existing codebases in:

- `project-doc/project-code/` folder — Primary location for code projects

#### Detect Code Project Indicators

- `.git/` directories (indicating git repositories)
- Common project structure patterns (`src/`, `lib/`, `components/`, `app/`, etc.)
- Package management files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `Gemfile`, etc.)
- Infrastructure as Code files (`*.tf`, `cdk.json`, CloudFormation templates, `docker-compose.yml`)
- Configuration files (`.env`, `config/`, `settings.py`, `application.properties`)
- Build files (`Makefile`, `build.gradle`, `webpack.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`)
- README files with project descriptions

---

### Project Classification

Classify detected projects by type and purpose:

- **Legacy System**: Production codebase for reference or codebase requiring migration or integration
- **Current Development**: Active development codebase needing enhancement
- **Reference Implementation**: Example code or templates for guidance
- **Infrastructure Project**: Contains IaC files (Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation)
- **Application Project**: Contains application code and dependencies
- **Microservices**: Multiple service directories in single repository
- **Monorepo**: Single repository containing multiple projects
- **Documentation Project**: Contains primarily documentation files

---

### Brownfield Analysis  
*(For existing codebases, perform additional analysis)*

- **Architecture Pattern Detection**: Identify MVC, microservices, serverless, monolithic patterns
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Identify languages, frameworks, databases, cloud services
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Identify outdated dependencies, deprecated patterns, security issues
- **Integration Points**: Identify APIs, databases, external services, and dependencies
- **Migration Complexity**: Assess effort required for modernization or cloud migration (if migration is needed)

---

### Automatic Ingestion  
*(When code projects are detected)*

- Copy ALL detected code projects to `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/[project-name]/`
- Preserve original folder structure within each project
- Include all files (code, configs, documentation, IaC files)

---

### Generate Analysis  
*(For each ingested project)*

- Create `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` for each ingested project with:
3. **Complexity Analysis**:
- **For documents**: Assess document complexity and density, identify parsing challenges
- **For user context**: Evaluate scope and detail level of provided information
- **For mixed input**: Combine document and context complexity assessment
- **For code projects**: Include ingested code projects in complexity assessment
- Estimate processing time requirements

4. **Risk Assessment**:
- Identify session timeout risks based on input complexity
- Assess potential memory constraints
- Consider context window limitations

5. **Recommendation Generation**:
- Provide clear complexity categorization
- Suggest optimal execution strategy
- Recommend session management approach

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Complexity Level**: Clear categorization (Simple/Moderate/Complex) documented
- **Input Analysis**: Input sources identified and analyzed (Documents, user context, images)
- **Code Project Ingestion**:
  - **If project-code folder has content**: All code projects copied to `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/` with `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` files
  - **If project-code folder is empty/missing**: Explicit documentation in handoff stating no code projects provided
- **Validation**: `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md` must contain explicit statement about code project detection results
- **Time Estimates**: Realistic time estimate provided (e.g., “2-3 hours”, “4-6 hours”)
- **Recommendations**: Specific guidance on workflow approach and session management
- **Progress Updates**: Project analysis task marked complete, requirements generation task set as current in `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`
