# Documentation Generation

## Overview

This module generates prescriptive guidance documentation, executive summaries, and comprehensive risk analysis to support implementation and stakeholder communication. It creates comprehensive MCP guidance, executive summaries, and project risk assessments that provide clear direction for development teams and key stakeholders.

**Concise Output Guidelines**:
- **README.md**: Keep navigation structure but use 2-5 sentences per section, avoid lengthy explanations
- **Executive Summary**: Keep business sections brief but use bullet points and direct statements instead of paragraphs
- **Supplement Material**: Keep all sections but limit to 2-5 key points per section, focus on actionable information

## Task 6.1: Tools Prescriptive Guidance Generation

### Purpose
Generate comprehensive guidance on available development tools (MCP servers and Skills) and their recommended usage patterns to support development teams in selecting and implementing the right tools for their project needs.

### Reference Documentation
**CRITICAL**: Before executing this task, review the comprehensive tools recommendation framework:
- **Tools Recommendation Guidance**: #[[file://.../steering/design-agent/tools-recommendation-guidance.md]]

This steering document provides:
- Complete MCP server categorization (Essential, High-Value, Conditional)
- ProServe Skills framework overview
- Project analysis criteria for tool selection
- Workflow integration patterns for each design stage
- Configuration templates and quality standards
- Professional recommendation frameworks

### Tools Recommendation Process

**Step 1: Project Analysis for Tools Selection**

1. **Load Tools Recommendation Framework**
   - Read `tools-recommendation-guidance.md` completely to understand the complete framework
   - Review MCP server categories (Essential, High-Value, Conditional)  
   - Review ProServe Skills framework
   - Study project analysis criteria and recommendation patterns
   - Understand configuration templates and quality standards

2. **Apply Project Characteristics Assessment**
   - **Project Type Analysis**: Determine if greenfield vs. existing system, web or backend, AI/ML components, agent-based solution, data-intensive budget-constrained
   - **Architecture Complexity Assessment**: Classify as simple, moderate, or complex based on project requirements
   - **Team Experience Evaluations**: Assess team’s AWS familiarity and tool preferences (efficiency vs. learning-oriented)
   - **Timeline and Resource Constraints**: Consider project timeline and resource availability

3. **MCP Server Categorization Using Frameworks**
   - **Essential MCPs**: Apply framework criteria to identify always-required (typically AWS Knowledge, AWS Diagram)
   - **High-Value MCPs**: Identify servers recommended for most projects (Git Repo Research, AWS Documentation)
   - **Conditional MCPs**: Select project-specific servers based on analysis (Code Documentation, Synthetic Data, AWS Pricing, Bedrock AgentCore, Frontend, AWS API)

4. **ProServe Skills Framework Evaluation**
   - **ProServe Skills**: Evaluate fit for agent-based multi-component architectures
   - **Customization Approach**: Determine if ProServe Skills should be used as foundation, extended/adapted, or reference only

**Step 2: Project-Specific Tools Recommendations**
1. **Apply Recommendation Framework Decision Tree**
   - Use project analysis results to navigate tools selection decision tree
   - Match project characteristics to MCP server categories and skills patterns
   - Apply business justification criteria for each recommendation
   - Follow framework patterns and avoid documented anti-patterns

2. **Generate Configuration Strategy**
   - Create minimal, focused toolset to avoid complexity overhead
   - Prioritize efficiency over comprehensiveness based on project constraints
   - Include complete configuration examples for MCPs following framework templates
   - Include repository URLs and integration guidance for skills
   - Document usage patterns for each recommended tool in project context

3. **Validate Recommendations Against Framework**
   - Ensure recommendations follow framework patterns (Essential MCPs → High-Value MCPs → Conditional MCPs → Skills)
   - Verify business justification for each selected MCP server and skill
   - Confirm configuration examples are complete and actionable
   - Validate ProServe Skills integration guidance is clear and specific
   - Check that anti-patterns are avoided (e.g., recommending all tools without justification)

## Task 6.4: Project Risk Analysis

### Purpose
Generate comprehensive risk analysis covering delivery risks that could impact project success across time, budget, quality, and scope dimensions. This analysis provides stakeholders with clear visibility into potential challenges and mitigation strategies.

### Risk Analysis Framework

**Step 1: Risk Category Assessment**
Analyze risks across four critical dimensions:

1. **Time/Schedule Risks**
   - Development timeline constraints and dependencies
   - Resource availability and allocation challenges
   - Technical complexity and learning curve impacts
   - Integration and testing timeline pressures
   - Deployment and go-live scheduling risks

2. **Budget/Cost Risks**
   - Development cost overruns and resource allocation
   - AWS service cost escalation and usage spikes
   - Third-party service and licensing costs
   - Operational cost projections and monitoring gaps
   - Hidden costs and unexpected expenses

3. **Quality Risks**
   - Technical debt and architecture quality concerns
   - Security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps
   - Performance and scalability limitations
   - User experience and accessibility issues
   - Testing coverage and validation gaps

4. **Scope Risks**
   - Requirements creep and scope expansion
   - Stakeholder expectation management
   - Feature complexity and implementation challenges
   - Integration scope and external dependencies
   - Regulatory and compliance scope changes

**Step 2: Risk Identification Process**
1. **Architecture Analysis**: Review architecture decisions and identify technical risks
2. **Requirements Review**: Analyze requirements for complexity and feasibility risks
3. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate team capabilities and resource constraints
4. **External Dependencies**: Identify third-party services and integration risks
5. **Timeline Analysis**: Assess schedule constraints and critical path risks
6. **Cost Modeling**: Analyze cost projections and budget constraints

**Step 3: Risk Prioritization Matrix**
Classify each risk using impact and probability assessment:

| Impact Level | Probability | Risk Level | Response Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **High** | High | **Critical** | Immediate mitigation required |
| **High** | Medium | **High** | Active monitoring and mitigation planning |
| **High** | Low | **Medium** | Contingency planning |
| **Medium** | High | **Medium** | Active Monitoring |
| **Medium** | Medium | **Low** | Periodic review |
| **Low** | Any | **Low** | Accept and monitor |
