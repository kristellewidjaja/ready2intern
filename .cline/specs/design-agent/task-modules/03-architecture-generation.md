# Stage 3: Architecture Generation

## Overview

**Objective**: Generate production-ready architecture design using either expert-guided Intelligence Hub analysis or systematic architecture generation with reference architecture integration.

**Dependencies**:

**Persona Focus**: Technical Lead / Solution Architect

**Critical Design Philosophy**: This stage provides two mutually exclusive architecture generation paths that converge into common architecture activities. Path selection is determined by Intelligence Hub availability, ensuring optimal architecture quality regardless of tooling constraints.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Intelligence Hub MCP Server**: Configuration checked for availability determination
- **Project Structure**: `generated/design/specification-package-iteration-1/` directory established
- **Workflow State**: `.workflow-state/` directory for context and reference storage

### Knowledge Dependencies
- **Architecture Generation Guide**: Core methodology and Intelligence Hub integration standards
- **Architecture Guidance Selection**: Framework for systematic guidance selection when Intelligence Hub unavailable
- **Customer Context**: Project characteristics and constraints for context-aware architecture design

## Task Descriptions

### Task 3.1: Check Intelligence Hub Availability

**Purpose**: Determine architecture generation path based on Intelligence Hub availability and establish execution parameters.

**Critical First Step**: Before any architecture generation activities, perform Intelligence Hub availability assessment:

#### MCP Configuration Verification
1. **Configuration Check**: Examine MCP configuration for Intelligence Hub MCP server entry
   - Locate `"intelligence-hub"` server in MCP configuration
   - Verify `"disabled"` status (false = available, true = disabled)
   - Document configuration state

2. **Connection Validation**: If enabled in configuration, verify actual server availability
   - Attempt connection to Intelligence Hub MCP server
   - Test basic connectivity and response
   - Document connection status and any error conditions

3. **Path Selection Decision**: Based on availability assessment results
   - **Available**: Intelligence Hub server configured, enabled, and responsive → Path A
   - **Unavailable**: Server disabled, not configured, or connection failed → Path B

4. **Document Path Selection in Workflow State**: Update `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`
   - Check the appropriate box in "Architecture Generation Path Selection" section
   - Path A: Check if Intelligence Hub available
   - Path B: Check if Intelligence Hub unavailable
   - Document path selection rationale explaining why this path was chosen
   - **CRITICAL**: This documentation ensures Task 3.2 follows the correct path

#### Execution Parameters Setup
- **Timeout Configuration**: Set appropriate timeouts based on selected path
- **User Communication**: Prepare user for expected execution timeline
- **Fallback Planning**: Document fallback procedures if primary path fails

### Task 3.2: Generate Architecture Design

**Purpose**: Execute architecture generation using the determined path, ensuring complete architecture design regardless of tooling availability. d

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before executing any architecture generation activities:
1. **Read `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`** to verify which path was selected in Task 3.1
2. **Check the "Architecture Generation Path Selection" section** to see which box is checked
3. **If path is not documented**, STOP and complete Task 3.1 first  

**MANDATORY PATH CONFIRMATION** (Display in chat before proceeding):

Based on the selected path, you MUST:
1. **Read the corresponding path section** in the Task Checklist below (PATH A or PATH B)
2. **Identify all step numbers** for the selected path (e.g., A1, A2, A3 or B1, B2, B3, B4, B5)
3. **Create a summary** listing each step by its step number and description
4. **Display the summary in chat using this format:

```
✔ Path [A/B] Selected: [Path Name]

I will execute the following Path [A/B] steps in order:
- Step [A/B]1: [Step name and brief description]
- Step [A/B]2: [Step name and brief description]
- Step [A/B]3: [Step name and brief description]
[Continue for all steps in the path]

Proceeding with Path [A/B] execution starting with Step [A/B]1...
```

**Example for Path A:**
```

I will execute the following Path A steps in order:
- Step A1: Prerequisites Verification and Deep Research Decision (verify hub, prompt user, document choice)
- Step A2: Intelligence Hub Job Execution (submit job, monitor status, retrieve results)
- Step A3: Expert Insights Integration (analyze rankings, review recommendations, document influence)

Proceeding with Path A execution starting with Step A1...
```

**Example for Path B:**
```
✔ Path B Selected: Standard Architecture Generation

I will execute the following Path B steps in order:
- Step B1: Prerequisites Verification (document unavailability, load context)
- Step B2: Architecture Guidance Selection (apply framework, display selection tree, document decision)
- Step B3: Reference Architecture Analysis (download references, follow instructions, gap analysis)
- Step B4: Reference Architecture Integration Design (design integration, plan customization, document specifications)

Proceeding with Path B execution starting with Step B1...
```

**CRITICAL**: After displaying the confirmation, execute ONLY the steps for the selected path in the exact order listed (A1→A2→A3 or B1→B2→B3→B4→B5). Do NOT skip any steps.  Do NOT skip ahead to TAsk 3.3 until ALL path-specific steps are complete and verified.

#### Path A: Intelligence Hub Integration (When Available)

```
MANDATORY USER CONSULTATION:

“Intelligence Hub supports deep research analysis which provides additional expert insights and recommendations but takes longer to complete (up to 1 hour vs. standard 10–15 minutes).

Deep research includes:
- Extended expert analysis with additional insights and alternative approaches
- Additional architectural guidance with trade-off analysis
- Review of industry standards, patterns, and best practices
