# Output Organization Requirements

## Overview

This module defines the mandatory folder structure and organization requirements for all Design Agent workflow outputs. Proper organization ensures consistency, traceability, and ease of handoff to development teams.

## Project Folder Structure

**CRITICAL**: All workflow outputs must be organized in a SINGLE project folder with quality iteration subfolders:

generated/design/
└── [project-name]/                        (SINGLE project folder - name extracted from customer context)
├── README.md                              # This navigation guide

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION**:
- **Quality Iterations**: specification-package-iteration-1, specification-package-iteration-2, etc. (within same project)
- **Feedback Iterations**: Only create NEW project folders when stakeholder feedback requires complete project regeneration (Task 8+)

## Organization Rules

### Project Name Extraction
- **Source**: Extract project name from `.workflow-state/customer-context.md` or project documents
- **Format**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens): `knowledge-base-assistant`, `payment-system`, `user-portal`
- **Fallbacks**: If no clear project name, use `project-specification` as default
- **Validation**: Ensure name is filesystem-safe and descriptive

### Single Project Folder Structure
- **Container Principle**: All deliverables must be contained within the `generated/design/[project-name]/` folder
- **No Scattered Files**: No deliverables should be created outside the project folder structure
- **Consistent Paths**: Project root path is always `generated/design/[project-name]/`
- **↕Quality Iterations**: Multiple specification-package-iteration-X folders in same project folder

### Quality Iteration Numbering (Within Same Project)
- **Specification Packages**: specification-package-iteration-1, specification-package-iteration-2, etc.
- **Score Sheets**: score-sheet-iteration-1, score-sheet-iteration-2, etc.
- **Quality Threshold**: Continue iterations until 90/100 quality threshold achieved
- **Final Deliverables**: executive-summary.md, threat-model/, supplement-material/ created once at project level

---

### Feedback Iteration Numbering (New Project Folders - Task 8+ Only)
- **New Project Folders**: Only when stakeholder feedback requires complete project regeneration
- **Naming**: [project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/, [project-name]-feedback-iteration-2/, etc.
- **Triggering**: Explicit stakeholder feedback documents in project-doc/feedback-iteration-N/
- **Complete Regeneration**: Each feedback iteration creates entirely new project folder

### Score Sheet Placement
- **Project Root Level**: Store sheets placed at project root level: `generated/design/[project-name]/`
- **Iteration Numbering**: score-sheet-iteration-1.md, score-sheet-iteration-2.md, etc.
- **Standalone Documents**: Each score sheet provides comprehensive feedback for that quality iteration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete progression of scores maintained at project level for audit purposes

### Threat Model Folder
- **Dedicated Folder**: Dedicated folder for all security assessment deliverables
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All threat modeling outputs contained within this folder
- **Structured Organization**: Logical organization of threat model components
- **Implementation Ready**: Security guidance ready for development teams to use

### Executive Summary
- **Project Root Level**: Single executive summary at project root: `generated/design/[project-name]/executive-summary.md`  
- **Final Document**: Created after achieving 90/100 quality threshold  
- **Comprehensive Overview**: Synthesizes final specifications with quality progression  
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Professional document suitable for executive and stakeholder review
- **Readiness Statement**: Clear assessment of final readiness and next steps

### README.md Navigation Guide
- **Project Root Level**: Navigation guide at project root: `generated/design/[project-name]/README.md`
- **Purpose**: Provides clear navigation and understanding of deliverables
- **Contents**: Project overview, folder structure explanation, key deliverable summary
- **Stakeholder Friendly**: Easy entry point for team members to find specific information  
- **Implementation Ready**: Clear guidance for development teams on where to find what

### Supplement Material
- **Supporting Documentation**: Supporting documentation including input assessment analysis  
- **MCP Prescriptive Guidance**: Comprehensive MCP server inventory and project-specific recommendations

## File Naming Conventions

### Project Folder

- **Name Source**: Extract from customer context or project documents
- **Format**: kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Single Folder**: One project folder contains all deliverables

### Specification Packages (Quality Iterations)
- **Format**: `specification-package-iteration-x/` within project folder
- **Sequential**: x = 1, 2, 3, etc. until 90/100 quality achieved
- **Complete**: Each contains complete set of specification package
- **Quality Focus**: Each iteration improves quality based on assessment

### Score Sheets (Quality Iterations)
- **Format**: `score-sheet-iteration-x.md` at project root level
- **Sequential**: x = 1, 2, etc. matching specification package iterations
- **Standalone**: Each score sheet is complete and standalone
- **Quality Tracking**: Shows progression toward 90/100 threshold

### Change Documentation
- **Format**: `changelog-from-iteration-X.md` (where X is the previous iteration number)
- **Feedback Traceability**: Documents specific changes made based on reviewer input
- **Impact Analysis**: Explains how feedback influenced specification updates
- **Decision Rationale**: Provides rationale for changes made or feedback not incorporated

### Threat Model Components
- **threat-analysis.md**: Core threat analysis and STRIDE assessment
- **security-controls.md**: Security controls mapping and implementation

- **Professional Format**: Suitable for executive and stakeholder presentation
- **Iteration Context**: Includes information about changes made in that iteration (for iterations 2+)

### README.md Navigation Guide
- **README.md**: Project navigation guide and overview at project root level
- **Content**: Project summary, folder structure, deliverables overview, implementation guidance
- **Format**: Professional markdown suitable for stakeholders and development teams
- **Purpose**: Single entry point for understanding complete project organization

### Supporting Documents
