## Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment

## Overview

**Objective**: Achieve 90/100 quality score through systematic holistic improvement
**Dependencies**:
- Architecture generation marked as complete in `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`
- `core-methodology/design-review.md` (comprehensive methodology reference)
**Strategy**: Deferred quality assessment – optimize requirements and architecture together

This stage conducts comprehensive quality assessment across all dimensions, optimizing requirements and architecture holistically rather than in isolation.

## Task 4.1: Assess Specification Quality

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Conduct comprehensive quality assessment with scoring across all dimensions in organized project structure

**Required Deliverables**:
- `generated/design/score-sheet-iteration-1.md` – Initial quality assessment
- `generated/design/specification-package-iteration-2/` – First improvement package (if improvements needed)

**Methodology Reference**: Follow complete assessment framework in `core-methodology/design-review.md` including:
- Multi-dimensional evaluation (5 weighted categories: Requirements 25%, Architecture 25%, Security 20%, Implementation 15%, Business Value 15%)
- Detailed scoring methodology with evidence-based assessment inputs
- Holistic evaluation approach with cross-domain analysis
- Quality verification controls and hallucination prevention frameworks

**CRITICAL: Security Assessment Scope and Boundaries**

This stage evaluates ONLY basic security foundation. Comprehensive security assessment is reserved for next stage.

** Security Scope (Basic Foundation Only)**:
- ✅ Authentication approach specified (IAM roles, user authentication)
- ✅ Authorization model defined (RBAC, least privilege)
- ✅ Encryption requirements specified (at-rest, in-transit using AWS KMS)
- ✅ Network security basics defined (VPC, security groups, private subnets)
- ✅ Secrets management approach (AWS Secrets Manager)
- ✅ Basic logging requirements (CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs)
- ✅ Reference to AWS security best practices

**Security Rightscaling Principle**:
Security depth should match project risk profile and end customer requirements. A POC with synthetic data appropriately implements basic security controls; production systems with customer data require comprehensive security measures. Both can achieve strong security scores when controls are appropriate to context.

**STRICTLY PROHIBITED in this stage (Reserved for next stage)**:
- ❌ STRIDE threat modeling or threat analysis
- ❌ Detailed security controls checklists or BSC coverage analysis
- ❌ Security testing framework development
- ❌ Vulnerability assessments or penetration testing plans
- ❌ Zero-Trust Architecture implementation
- ❌ Advanced security monitoring or SIEM integration
- ❌ Detailed compliance framework implementation
- ❌ Security-specific deliverables or dedicated security folders
- ❌ Comprehensive security controls mapping
- ❌ Security incident response procedures

**Assessment Guidance**:
- Focus ONLY on whether basic security approaches are specified in architecture
- DO NOT evaluate comprehensiveness or depth of security controls
- DO NOT flag missing advanced security features as gaps
- Score based on appropriateness to project type and risk profile
- Reserve detailed security evaluation for next stage

**Compliance Handling**:
- DO NOT interpret compliance requirements or determine what regulations apply (see Legal and Compliance Boundaries in collaboration-workflow.md)
- If customer mentions compliance needs (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, etc.): document as customer-stated requirement in `customer-context.md`
- CAN help implement technical controls (encryption, access controls, auditing) without claiming compliance
- Direct customer to their own independent legal counsel for compliance requirements determination

**Rationale**: This stage establishes baseline security foundation; Next stage builds comprehensive threat model on this foundation.

**CRITICAL SECURITY SCOPE LIMITATIONS**:
- **Stage 4 Security Focus**: Basic security considerations, security requirements validation, architectural security patterns
- **Stage 5 Security Focus**: Comprehensive threat modeling, detailed security controls, STRIDE analysis
- **DO NOT**: Create assessment threat models, detailed security controls, or STRIDE analysis in Stage 4
- **DO**: Assess basic security requirements, architectural security patterns and security readiness for Stage 5

### Key Activities

### Initial Assessment
- **Customer Context Review**: Read `.workflow-state/customer-context.md` to understand project type (POC/MVP/Production) and adjust scoring expectations accordingly 
- **Comprehensive Review**: Review complete specification from requirements generation and architecture generation stage  
- **Apply Methodology**: Use complete assessment framework from `core-methodology/design-review.md`  
- **Security Scope Limitations**: Focus on baseline security requirements and architectural patterns only – defer comprehensive threat modeling to Stage 5  
- **Issue Identification**: Identify critical issues and improvement opportunities (excluding detailed security analysis)
- **Priority Assessment**: Prioritize improvements by impact and effort

**Context-Aware Scoring Notes**: A POC with basic monitoring and simple error handling may score 90/100 if appropriate for concept validation. A Production system design requires comprehensive operational excellence for the same score.

**IMPORTANT**: If the customer explicitly requested specific requirements (e.g., comprehensive audit logging, advanced security monitoring), those MUST be included and scored regardless of project type. Only suggest simplification for requirements that were NOT explicitly requested by the customer. When in doubt, reference the requirements traceability matrix for source.

#### Score Sheet Generation
- **Follow OUTPUT 1 Requirements**: Generate standalone score sheet following exact format in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Evidence-Based Scoring**: All assessments must reference specific project specification content
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Provide category-by-category scoring with specific document references
- **Critical Issues**: Highlight critical risk issues and supporting immediate actions
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Provide specific, actionable improvement recommendations
- **Security Scope Compliance**: DO NOT flag missing advanced security features as gaps – only assess basic security foundation as defined in methodology

#### Initial Improvement Package (if needed)
- **Follow OUTPUT 2 Requirements**: Create improved package following exact format in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Iteration 2 Creation**: Create improved package in iteration-2 folder if score < 90/100
- **File Management**: Modified files get "-improved" suffix, unchanged files copied from previous iteration
- **Cross-Domain Optimization**: Optimize requirements and architecture together

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Methodology Compliance**: Assessment follows complete framework in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Organized Output**: Score sheet placed in project root folder with clear naming
- **Evidence-Based Scoring**: All scores reference specific specification content
- **Critical Issues Identified**: All critical issues identified with improvement roadmap
- **Initial Improvement**: If score < 90/100, iteration-2 package created with improvements

## Task 4.2: Improve Requirements and Architecture
