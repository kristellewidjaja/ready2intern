# Design Agent Workflow

## Overview

**Purpose**: Seven-stage orchestrated workflow that transforms multi-category project inputs into enterprise-grade specification packages through enhanced context classification, systematic requirements generation, policy-driven architecture design, holistic quality assessment, and comprehensive security evaluation.

**Modular Benefits**:
- Focused, modular task files enable parallel development and avoid merge conflicts
- Each module covers a single workflow stage with complete execution instructions
- Clear separation between orchestration (this file) and detailed task execution (individual modules)
- Easy navigation to find specific task instructions quickly

## Prerequisites

### Enhanced Context Sources and Discovery Protocol
**Every task must load context from these standardized locations in this order**:

1. **`.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`** - Input scenario and workflow state
   - Read first to understand current workflow state and input scenario
   - Contains input scenario determination (Existing documents/Start from scratch/Mixed/Insufficient)
   - Contains progress tracking and task coordination information

2. **`.workflow-state/customer-context.md`** - Captured customer context
   - Always created during session management (Task 0.0)
   - Contains structured customer context (project goals, technical preferences, organizational context)
   - Load for all tasks requiring customer context

3. **Enhanced Input Analysis** - User-provided materials organized by processing stage:

  **For Requirements Generation (Stage 2)**:
  **3a. `project-doc/project-context/`** - Project-specific requirements and context
  - Core business objectives, functional requirements, and user stories
  - Project-specific constraints, preferences, and stakeholder needs
  - Primary source for "what we’re building"

  **3b. `project-doc/technical-knowledge/`** - External reference materials
  - External API documentation, integration specifications, and system references
  - Service limits, authentication patterns, and compatibility requirements
  - Source for "what we’re integrating with" (NOT what we're building)

  **3c. `project-doc/organization-context/`** - Organizational policies and standards
  - Company naming conventions, tagging strategies, and resource patterns
  - Security policies, compliance requirements, and budget constraints
  - Organizational standards that must be applied to all architecture decisions

  **For Architecture Generation (Stage 3)**:
  **3d. `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/`** - Analyzed existing codebases (from Stage 1)
  - Brownfield analysis results, existing code structure, and integration patterns
  - Reference system dependencies and compatibility requirements
  - Source for "what we can leverage or integrate with"

4. **Current User Prompt** - Additional context from current request
   - Extract images, descriptions, requirements provided in current session
   - Integrate with other context sources for comprehensive analysis

**Stage-Specific Processing Rules**:
- **Stage 2 (Requirements)**: Process only project-context, technical-knowledge, and organization-context
- **NEVER** treat technical-knowledge materials as project build targets
- **ALWAYS** apply organization-context policies across all architecture decisions
- **CLEARLY** separate project requirements from external integration needs
- **Stage 3 (Architecture)**: Incorporate reference system analysis from Stage 1 to inform architecture decisions

## Execution Instructions

### Core Execution Rules

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**:
- **Source-traceable information only** – All information must come from verifiable sources: project documents, customer interactions, steering documents, MCP tool responses, or current prompt
- **Never invent or assume** - Do not add information from memory, experience, or assumptions not explicitly provided by traceable sources
- **Trust erosion prevention** - Inventing information appears as hallucination and destroys user trust
- **Document information sources** – All analysis, recommendations, and outputs must be traceable to specific, identifiable sources

**EXECUTION PATTERN**:
1. **LOAD** the task module file completely
2. **FOLLOW** the Context Sources and Discovery Protocol (read workflow state first)
3. **COMPLETE** the Task Checklist at the end of that module
4. **UPDATE** workflow state after task completion (write progress and status)
5. **ONLY THEN** proceed to the next stage

**WORKFLOW STATE MANAGEMENT**:
- **Read before each task** – Always load current workflow state from `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md` before starting any task
- **Update after each task** – Always update workflow state with progress and completion status after finishing any task
- **State continuity** – Workflow state enables session recovery and progress tracking across task executions

**NAVIGATION RULE**: This file is a navigation hub only. All actual task execution must follow the individual task modules. **DO NOT** execute tasks based on summaries in this file.

### Enhanced Focus Areas by Processing Stage

**Stage 2 – Requirements Generation (Three Categories Only)**:

**When processing project-context materials**:
– Extract core business objectives and functional requirements
– Identify user personas, workflows, and success criterias
– Document project-specific constraints and technical preferences
– Generate primary requirements that define "what we’re building"

**When processing technical-knowledge materials**:
– Analyze external API documentation WITHOUT treating as build targets
– Extract integration patterns, data formats, and authentication requirements
– Identify service limits, rate limits, and compatibility constraints
– Document how external systems influence architecture decisions
– Generate integration requirements that define "what we’re integrating with"

**When processing organization-context materials**:
– Extract naming conventions, tagging strategies, and resource patterns
– Apply security policies, compliance requirements, and budget constraints
– Enforce organizational standards across all architecture decisions
– Validate against company-specific requirements (MAP credits, cost allocation)
– Generate organizational constraints that define "how we must build"

**Stage 3 – Architecture Generation (Requirements + Reference Analysis)**:

**When incorporating reference system analysis (from Stage 1)**:
– Use comprehensive brownfield analysis from `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/`
– Identify reusable components and integration opportunities
– Document reference system dependencies and compatibility requirements
– Generate integration strategies balancing requirements with existing assets
– Balance new requirements with existing system integration opportunities

**When working with requirements and reference analysis**:
– Maintain clear separation between requirements-driven needs and existing system capabilities
– Resolve conflicts between requirements and existing system constraints
– Apply organizational constraints consistently across all architecture decisions
– Ensure reference system integration supports rather than drives requirements

### Escalation Triggers

**Immediate escalation required when**:
– Critical information gaps prevent workflow completion
– Fundamental conflicts between requirements and constraints
– Technical feasibility concerns that cannot be resolved
– Customer context insufficient for informed decision-making
– Quality thresholds cannot be achieved with available information

**Escalation process**:
1. Document specific issue and attempted resolution approaches
2. Identify minimum information needed to proceed
3. Present clear options and trade-offs to customer
4. Obtain explicit customer decision before proceeding
5. Document decision rationale in workflow state

### Success Criteria

**Overall workflow success**:
– Complete specification package with 90/100+ quality score
– Comprehensive threat model with security controls integration
– Stakeholder validation and acceptance
– All deliverables organized for seamless handoff

**Per-stage success criteria**:
– Each stage must meet its specific acceptance criteria before progression
– Quality gates enforced at stage transitions
– Continuous validation against customer context and requirements
– Documentation completeness verified at each stage
