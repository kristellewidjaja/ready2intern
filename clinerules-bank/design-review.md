# Holistic Quality Assessment Methodology

This methodology provides a framework for conducting holistic quality assessment of specification packages, optimizing requirements and architecture together. The approach is aligned with AWS Professional Services' Global Delivery Framework (GDF) and quality standards, using a deferred quality assessment for optimal outcomes.

## Your Expertise Areas

- **Enterprise Architecture**: Multi-tenant systems, microservices, cloud-native architectures
- **AI/ML Systems**: Model deployment, MLOps, agent orchestration, document processing
- **System Integration**: API design, data flows, legacy system integration
- **Performance & Scalability**: High-throughput systems, disaster recovery, monitoring
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, audit trails, AWS Baseline Security Controls (BSC), Zero-Trust Architecture

## Holistic Assessment Framework

You will evaluate complete specification packages (requirements + architecture together) across multiple dimensions using a structured approach that ensures complete coverage and cross-domain optimization. This deferred quality assessment strategy allows for holistic optimization rather than isolated domain improvements.

## Deferred Quality Assessment Strategy

### Approach Benefits
- **Holistic Optimization**: Requirements and architecture optimized together for better overall outcomes
- **Cross-Domain Synergy**: Improvements in one domain inform and enhance the other
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Single complete assessment instead of multiple fragmented reviews
- **Natural Development Flow**: Mirrors real-world enterprise development where complete context enables better decisions

### Assessment Timing
- **Requirements Generated First**: Complete requirements package created without quality gates
- **Architecture Generated Second**: Complete architecture design based on stable requirements
- **Holistic Assessment Third**: Complete quality evaluation of integrated solution
- **Iterative Improvement**: Requirements and architecture improved together until 90/100 achieved

### OUTPUT 2: Improved Specification Package

This output provides a complete, improved version of the specification package that incorporates all feedback from the scoring assessment. **The structure must remain idential to the original specification package and must be organized in a new iteration folder.**

#### Folder Structure Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Create a new folder named `specification-package-iteration-X/` where X is the iteration number
- **First Iteration**: Original package goes in `specification-package-iteration-1/`
- **Subsequent Iterations**: Improved packages go in `specification-package-iteration-2/`, `specification-package-iteration-3/`, etc.
- Maintain the exact same internal folder structure as the original package within each iteration folder
- Keep the same document names and organization within each iteration folder
- Add new content only where gaps were identified
- Enhance existing content based on review feedback

#### Improvement Integration Guidelines (if improvements are needed)
- **Requirements Documents**: Enhance clarity, add missing requirements, improve acceptance criteria, strengthen RTM
  - Modified files: Add "-improved" suffix (e.g., `functional-requirements-improved.md`)
  - Unchanged files: Copy from previous iteration without modification
- **Architecture Documents**: Strengthen architectural decisions, add missing components, improve integration strategies
  - Modified files: Add "-improved" suffix (e.g., `architecture-decisions-improved.md`)
  - Unchanged files: Copy from previous iteration without modification
- **User Stories**: Refine acceptance criteria, add missing stories, improve traceability
  - Modified files: Add "-improved" suffix (e.g., `user-stories-improved.md`)
  - Unchanged files: Copy from previous iteration without modification  
- **README and Navigation**: Update to reflect improvement notes and additions
  - Always update README to reflect current iteration status and improvements made

#### Quality Standards for Improved Package
- All critical issues from OUTPUT 1 must be addressed
- Important improvements should be incorporated where feasible
- Optimization opportunities should be considered for inclusion
- Consistency across all documents must be maintained
- Professional quality formatting and styling standards must be met
- **Iteration Completeness**: Each iteration folder must contain the complete specification package

#### Validation Requirements
- Improved package should score significantly higher if re-reviewed
- All original business objectives must still be met
- No new critical risks should be introduced
- Implementation feasibility must be maintained or improved
- Stakeholder needs must continue to be addressed
- **90/100 Target**: Continue iterations until achieving minimum 90/100 score

#### Iteration Folder Example Structure
```
specification-package-iteration-2/
├── requirements/
│   ├── functional-requirements-improved.md     (modified from iteration 1)
│   ├── non-functional-requirements.md          (copied unchanged from iteration 1)
│   └── requirements-traceability-matrix-improved.md (modified from iteration 1)
├── user-stories/
│   └── user-stories-improved.md                (modified from iteration 1)

└── README.md                                   (updated to reflect iteration 2 improvements)
```

## Iterative Review Process

### Multiple Iteration Support
This design review process supports iterative refinement cycles with mandatory continuation until 90/100 score:
1. **Iteration Tracking**: Each review iteration should be clearly identified (e.g., "Iteration 1", "Iteration 2")
2. **Progress Documentation**: Document improvements made since previous iteration
3. **Score Progression**: Track score improvements across iterations with detailed comparison
4. **Convergence Target**: **MANDATORY**: Continue iterations until minimum 90/100 score
5. **Standalone Score Sheets**: Each iteration produces a new, complete score sheet
6. **Folder Structure Management**: Each iteration creates a new complete specification package folder
7. **File Management**: Only copy over the files from the previous iteration if they are unchanged. Otherwise, only include the updated files in each iteration.

### Iteration-Specific Instructions
- **First Iteration**: Review the original generated specification package from `specification-package-iteration-1/`
- **Subsequent Iterations**: Review the most recent improved specification from the latest iteration folder
- **Score Comparison**: Compare current review with previous iteration scores and document progression
- **Remaining Issues**: Focus on issues not yet resolved from previous iterations
- **Incremental Improvement**: Ensure each iteration shows measurable progress toward 90/100 target
- **Mandatory Continuation Rule**: If current score < 90/100, MUST proceed to next iteration
- **Maximum Iterations**: Continue up to 5 iterations if necessary to reach the 90/100 target

### Folder Structure Requirements for Each Iteration
Each iteration must create a new complete specification package folder:

```
specification-package-iteration-1/   (original generated package)
├── requirements/
│   ├── functional-requirements.md
│   ├── non-functional-requirements.md
│   └── requirements-traceability-matrix.md
├── user-stories/
│   └── user-stories.md
├── architecture/
│   └── architecture-decisions.md
└── README.md

specification-package-iteration-2/   (first improved package)
├── requirements/
│   ├── functional-requirements-improved.md     (if modified)
│   ├── non-functional-requirements.md          (copied if unchanged)
│   └── requirements-traceability-matrix-improved.md (if modified)
├── user-stories/
│   └── user-stories-improved.md                (if modified)
├── architecture/
│   └── architecture-decisions.md               (copied if unchanged)
└── README.md                                   (copied if unchanged)
```

### Score Progression Tracking
Each iteration’s score sheet must include:

````markdown
## Score Progression Summary
| Iteration | Overall Score | Change from Previous | Key Improvements Made |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1         | X/100          | N/A (baseline)         | N/A (baseline)         |
| 2         | Y/100          | +Z points              | [List key improvements]|
| 3         | A/100          | +B points              | [List key improvements]|

## Security Control Coverage Progression
| Iteration | BSC Coverage | STRIDE Coverage | Residual Threats | Security Score |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1         | X%           | Y%              | Z threats        | A/20 points    |
| 2         | X%           | Y%              | Z threats        | A/20 points    |
| 3         | X%           | Y%              | Z threats        | A/20 points    |

**Security Improvement Focus by Iteration:**
- Iteration 1: Identify missing BSC controls and security gaps
- Iteration 2: Implement critical security controls and address high-priority threats
- Iteration 3+: Achieve zero-threat architecture target with 100% BSC coverage

## Remaining Issues to Address
- Issue 1: [Description and target iteration for resolution]
- Issue 2: [Description and target iteration for resolution]

## Target for Next Iteration
**Target Score**: [Target score for next iteration]
**Key Focus Areas**: [Areas requiring most attention]
**Expected Completion**: [If score ≥ 90, indicate "Final iteration expected"]
```

## Important Notes
1. **Both outputs are mandatory** – Never provide only one output
2. **Maintain original structure** – The improved package must follow the exact same organization as the original
3. **Be comprehensive** – Address all identified issues and improvement points
4. **Stay consistent** – Ensure all documents in the improved package align with each other
5. **Preserve intent** – Maintain the original business objectives and scope while improving quality
6. **Iterative Progress** – Each iteration should show measurable improvement toward the 90/100 target
