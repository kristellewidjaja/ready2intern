## ProServe Skills for Design Agent

### ProServe Skills

**Purpose**: AWS ProServe pre-built, reusable components implementing common AWS patterns
**Repository**: https://code.aws.dev/proserve/proserve-apex/proserve-skills
**Complete Documentation**: See `AGENT.md` in repository for comprehensive usage guidelines, available skills, and implementation process

**Overview**:
ProServe Skills are self-contained components with Infrastructure as Code (CDK/CloudFormation), configuration management, deployment scripts, testing, and complete documentation. Skills include identity management, AgentCore networking and runtime, knowledge bases, user interfaces, Lambda functions, and agent evaluation frameworks.

**When to Recommend**:
- Conversational AI applications with multi-component architecture
- Agent-based solutions requiring identity management or AgentCore Runtime
- Projects needing Bedrock Knowledge Base, agent deployment, or coordinated multi-component deployment
- GenAI applications where proven reference patterns can accelerate development
- Projects using CDK or CloudFormation for infrastructure

**Functional Fit Assessment**:
- **Multi-Component Needs**: Project requires coordinated identity, agent, API, and UI components
- **AgentCore Runtime**: Project can leverage AgentCore Runtime for agent/MCP deployment
- **Authentication Integration**: Standard Cognito authentication fits security requirements
- **Configuration Management**: Project can use central `project/config.yaml` for dependency coordination
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Project uses CDK or CloudFormation

**Customization Decision Framework**:

**Use As Foundation When**:
- Standard multi-component agent architecture fits project needs
- Proven authentication and deployment patterns are acceptable  
- Time-to-market benefits outweigh customization constraints  
- Project uses CDK/CloudFormation for infrastructure  

**Extend and Adapt When**:
- Core patterns fit but additional functionality or integration required
- Standard components provide solid foundation for custom extensions
- Specific skills need customization for project requirements

**Use as Reference When**:
- Project architecture differs significantly from standard patterns
- Custom frameworks or authentication approaches required
- Project uses different IaC tools (Terraform, etc.)

**Implementation Guidance**:

For complete details on available skills, implementation process, configuration management, and usage patterns, refer to `AGENT.md` in the ProServe Skills repository. The AGENT.md file provides:
- Complete list of available skills with descriptions
- Implementation process
- Configuration management patterns with `project/config.yaml`
- SKILL.md documentation structure for each skill

## Tools Recommendation Framework

### Project Analysis Decision Tree

Use this systematic approach to analyze project characteristics and generate tool recommendations:

#### Step 1: Project Type Classification
**Analyze project characteristics to determine tool needs**:

```
Project Type Assessment:
├─ Greenfield vs. Existing System
│  ├─ Greenfield → Focus on Essential MCPs + ProServe Skills for patterns
│  └─ Existing System → Add Code Documentation Generator MCP
├─ Application Type
│  ├─ Web Application → Consider Frontend MCP
│  ├─ AI/ML Application → Consider Bedrock AgentCore MCP
│  ├─ Agent-Based Solution → Strongly Consider ProServe Skills
│  ├─ Data-Intensive → Consider Synthetic Data MCP
│  └─ Standard Application → Essential MCPs
├─ Budget Constraints
│  ├─ Budget-Constrained → Add AWS Pricing MCP (mandatory)
│  └─ Standard Budget → AWS Pricing MCP (optional)
└─ Validation Requirements
   ├─ Real-time Validation Needed → Add AWS API MCP
   └─ Standard Validation → Use AWS Documentation MCP
```

#### Step 2: Architecture Complexity Assessment
**Determine tool scope based on project complexity**:

| Complexity Level | Indicators | MCP Recommendation | ProServe Skills Recommendation |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Simple** | Single service, basic functionality, small team | Essential MCPs only | Consider as reference only |
| **Moderate** | Multiple services, standard patterns, experienced team | Essential + High-Value MCPs | Consider if agent-based architecture |
| **Complex** | Distributed architecture, custom patterns, large team | Essential + High-Value + Conditional MCPs | Strongly recommend for enterprise patterns |

#### Step 3: Team Experience Evaluation
**Adjust recommendations based on team capabilities**:

| Experience Level | Characteristics | MCP Focus | ProServe Skills Focus |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Experienced** | AWS-familiar, efficiency-focused | Efficiency MCPs (diagrams, automation) | Reference patterns for acceleration |
| **Learning** | New to AWS, guidance-needed | Guidance MCPs (knowledge, documentation) | Detailed implementation templates |
| **Mixed** | Varied experience levels | Balanced approach with both guidance and efficiency | Mix of reference patterns and detailed templates |

#### Step 4: Timeline and Resource Constraints
**Consider project constraints for tool selection**:

| Constraint Type | Impact on MCP Selection | Impact on ProServe Skills Selection |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Tight Timeline** | Minimal MCP set, focus on essential only | Prioritize proven patterns for rapid development |
| **Standard Timeline** | Full recommended MCP set | Balanced use of reference patterns |
| **Extended Timeline** | Include optional validation MCPs | Opportunity for custom implementations |
| **Limited Resources** | Prioritize automation MCPs (diagrams, code generation) | Leverage complete implementation templates |
| **Ample Resources** | Include comprehensive MCP set with validation tools | Mix of reference patterns and custom development |
