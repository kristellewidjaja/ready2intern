# Threat Model Generation Methodology v2.0

## Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach for generating comprehensive, enterprise-grade threat model documents that follow industry best practices including STRIDE methodology, AWS security standards, and OWASP guidelines. This guide is designed to produce detailed threat models similar to AWS ThreatComposer outputs and enterprise security assessments.

## Target Output Format

**CRITICAL**: The threat models generated using this methodology MUST follow the EXACT format defined in the template file: `docs/threat-model-template.md`

### Template Reference

The complete threat model template is located at: **`docs/threat-model-template.md`**

This template defines:
- All required document sections (Application Info, Architecture, DataFlow, Assumptions, Threats, Mitigations, Impacted Assets, Existing Controls, Residual Threats)
- Exact table formats with all required columns
- Threat statement structure requirements
- Cross-referencing rules with markdown anchor links
- Diagram requirements (architecture and dataflow ASCII diagrams)
- Evidence-based threat requirements with prefixes
- Quality validation checklist
- Template enforcement rules

**DO NOT deviate from the template format.** Follow the template at `docs/threat-model-template.md` exactly to ensure consistency and quality.

### Required Sections Quick Reference

The threat model MUST include these 10 sections in order:

1. **Application Info** (with disclaimers, summary, features, architecture references)
2. **Architecture** (with ASCII diagram, components, workflow)
3. **DataFlow** (with entities, flows, trust boundaries, ASCII diagram)
4. **Assumptions Table** (with cross-references to threats and mitigations)
5. **Threats Table** (with cross-references to mitigations and assumptions)
6. **Mitigations Table** (with cross-references to threats and assumptions)
7. **Impacted Assets Table** (with cross-references to related threats)
8. **Existing Controls Table** (with evidence, effectiveness, gaps)
9. **Residual Threats Table** (with recommended mitigations, priority, effort)
10. **AWS Well-Architected Mappings** (optional)

## Security Analysis Principles

### Objectivity and Thoroughness Requirements

All threat model analyses must maintain rigorous objectivity and avoid these problematic patterns:

### Red Flags to Avoid:

1. **Overly Defensive Tone**
   - DO NOT write like an advocate trying to minimize security concerns
   - DO maintain objective, analytical tone throughout
   - DO acknowledge legitimate security risks without downplaying them

2. **Scope Minimization**
   - DO NOT understate the system’s actual capabilities or reach
   - DO NOT ignore indirect impacts (e.g., "system doesn't process data" while ignoring that it influences systems that DO process data)
   - DO consider the full scope of influence, including downstream effects
   - DO analyze what the system actually enables, not just what it directly does

3. **Risk Dismissal Patterns**
   - DO NOT systematically dismiss security concerns without thorough investigation
   - DO NOT use dismissive language without detailed justification
   - DO NOT provide substantive analysis for why risks are or aren’t applicable
   - DO explain the reasoning behind risk assessments

4. **Contradictory Evidence Gaps**
   - DO NOT mention security features without explaining why they’re necessary
   - DO explain why security controls exist and what threats they address
   - DO ensure consistency between stated risk levels and implemented controls

5. **Responsibility Shifting**
   - DO NOT dismiss risks by claiming “other systems will handle security”
   - DO NOT ignore how your system influences or enables security risks in other systems
   - DO analyze the security implications of your system’s role in the broader ecosystem
   - DO consider how your system’s outputs or behaviors affect downstream security

### Analysis Quality Indicators:

**High-Quality Analysis Includes**:
- Detailed investigation of each potential threat vector
- Clear explanation of why certain risks apply or don’t apply
- Consideration of both direct and indirect security impacts
- Acknowledgment of limitations and areas requiring further review
- Consistent tone that prioritizes security over convenience
- Specific, actionable mitigations with measurable outcomes

**Warning Signs of Poor Analysis**:
- Repetitive justifications that sound like marketing copy
- Systematic dismissal of entire threat categories
- Vague statements about security without specific details
- Contradictions between stated risk levels and security measures
- Focus on what the system "doesn't do" rather than what it enables

## Threat Model Development Framework

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

#### Required Inputs

Comprehensive threat modeling requires analysis of:

1. **Project Documentation**

   - User stories and use cases
   - Compliance requirements
   - Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component descriptions
   - Technology stack details
   - Deployment architecture
   - Network topology

3. **API and Interface Specifications**
   - API endpoint definitions
   - Authentication/authorization mechanisms
   - Data formats and protocols
   - Integration points

4. **Data Architecture**
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Data classification
   - Storage locations
   - Data lifecycle

5. **Security Requirements**
   - Existing security controls
   - Compliance constraints
   - Security policies
   - Incident response procedures

### Phase 2: Document Structure Creation

#### 1. Document Header and Executive Summary

**Template**:

**NOTE**: The following sections are extracted from `docs/threat-model-template.md` and embedded here for immediate reference. For the complete template with all examples and detailed guidance, refer to the template file.

---

```markdown
# {Application Name} - Threat Model

This rule defines the EXACT format for generating AWS ProServe quality threat models following the ThreatComposer standard.

## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. All Content MUST Be in TABLE Format
- NO paragraph sections
- NO "Key Security Concerns" sections
- NO coverage percentages
- Use tables for ALL assumptions, threats, and mitigations

### 2. ID Format Requirements
- Assumptions: `A-0001`, `A-0002`, etc.
- Threats: `T-0001`, `T-0002`, etc.
- Mitigations: `M-0001`, `M-0002`, etc.
- ALL IDs must be cross-referenced with markdown links: `[**T-0001**](#T-0001)`

### 3. Threat Statement Structure
Every threat MUST follow this exact format:
```
A [threat actor] who [capability] can [action], which leads to [impact], resulting in [business impact]
```

**Good Example**:
```
A malicious user who has stolen valid credentials can bypass MFA by exploiting session token reuse, which leads to unauthorized access to betting workflows, resulting in fraudulent betting activity and financial loss
```

**Bad Example (too vague)**:
```
An attacker can compromise the system and cause damage
```

**Key Elements**:
- **Threat Actor**: Be specific (malicious user, insider, external attacker, compromised account)
- **Capability**: What enables the attack (stolen credentials, network access, admin privileges)
- **Action**: Specific exploit or attack method (bypass MFA, inject SQL, redirect traffic)
- **Impact**: Technical consequence (unauthorized access, data breach, service disruption)
- **Business Impact**: Real-world consequence (financial loss, compliance violation, reputational damage)

## REQUIRED DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

### Section 1: Application Info

#### Disclaimers (REQUIRED)

_**1. Motivation for externalizing this threat model:**_

_This threat model for '[Application Name]' is informational only and provided "as is" with no representations or warranties whatsoever, and may change at any time due to a variety of factors, such as changes to AWS's services. The provision of this threat model does not create any warranties, representations, contractual commitments, conditions or assurances from AWS, its affiliates, suppliers or licensors. This threat model is a comprehensive security analysis and is not suitable for every possible interaction or use case. It aims to provide a detailed assessment of threats, assumptions and mitigations specific to this application. You may have different perspectives on the assumptions, threats, mitigations and prioritization based on your organization's risk appetite. You may use this threat model as the base or starting point to generate a contextualized threat model for your own specific needs and deployment. This threat model uses the actual system architecture and is tailored to the specific implementation. You are solely responsible for making your own independent assessment of this threat model and its applicability to your organization._

_**2. Criteria for prioritizing threats:**_

_In this threat model, threats are prioritized based on their potential impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of the system and data. The prioritization considers the specific business context, regulatory requirements, and operational constraints of the application. Please note, these priorities are based on the current system architecture and threat landscape. Organizations should calculate priority using their own factors as part of any internal risk frameworks._

_**3. Agreement:**_

_All use of AWS’s services will be governed by the AWS Customer Agreement available at [http://aws.amazon.com/agreement/] (or other definitive written agreement as may be agreed between the parties governing the use of AWS’s services). If you use any artificial intelligence and machine learning Services, features, and functionality (including third-party models) that we provide, you will comply with the AWS Responsible AI Policy._

- **Threats Addressed**: Threats this control mitigates, with full threat statements using `<br/>` separator
- **Effectiveness**: Effective, Partial, or Ineffective (with brief explanation)
- **Gaps/Weaknesses**: Specific limitations or weaknesses in current implementation
- **Comments**: HTML formatted recommendations using `<p>` tags, AWS Well-Architected mappings, implementation improvements

**Control Type Definitions**:
- **Preventive**: Controls that prevent security incidents (e.g., IAM policies, encryption, MFA)
- **Detective**: Controls that detect security incidents (e.g., CloudWatch alarms, GuardDuty, CloudTrail)
- **Corrective**: Controls that correct security incidents (e.g., automated remediation, incident response)

**Effectiveness Levels**:
- **Effective**: Control fully addresses the threat with no significant gaps
- **Partial**: Control addresses the threat but has limitations or gaps
- **Ineffective**: Control does not adequately address the threat

**Evidence Requirements**:
- MUST include specific file paths, line numbers, or configuration details
- MUST use evidence prefixes: "**Found in repo**:", "**Found in image**:", "**Found in architecture**:", "**Found in diagram**:"
- MUST reference actual component names and configurations
- MUST quantify effectiveness where possible (e.g., "covers 80% of API endpoints")

### Section 9: Residual Threats and Recommended Mitigations Table

**PURPOSE**: This section translates the gaps identified in Existing Controls (Section 8) into an actionable remediation roadmap. While the Existing Controls table shows "what's wrong," this table shows "what to do about it" with priorities, effort estimates, and validation steps."

**CRITICAL MAPPING REQUIREMENT**: Each Residual Threat MUST correspond to an Existing Control marked as "Partial" or "Ineffective".

**Important Notes**:
- If one Existing Control has multiple gaps affecting different threats, create separate RT entries for each gap
- Example: EC-0005 (CloudWatch Logs) addresses both T-0006 (log retention) and T-0008 (log sanitization) with "Partial" effectiveness ➜ Create RT-0005 for T-0006 gap AND RT-0007 for T-0008 gap
- **Validation**: Count your "Partial" and "Ineffective" ECs, then verify you have at least that many RT entries (may be more if ECs address multiple threats)

**Target Audiences**:
- **Implementation Teams**: Detailed steps for remediation
- **Project Managers**: Effort estimates and priorities for planning
- **Executives**: Risk reduction ROI and business justification
- **Compliance Teams**: Remediation roadmap for audit findings

## Best Practices

### Do’s
- **Use specific, measurable language** with quantified metrics (e.g., "51% coverage", "10,000 req/sec")
- **Provide detailed attack scenarios** with numbered steps
- **Include realistic impact assessments** with dollar amounts
- **Consider both technical and business impacts** in every threat
- **Document assumptions clearly** with rationale
- **Update regularly** as system evolves (quarterly minimum)
- **Quantify current security posture** using the Existing Controls Mapping section
- **Use visual indicators** (✅ ⚠️ ❌) for quick scanning
- **Include actual configuration values** from architecture documentation
- **Calculate coverage percentages** for all threat categories

### Don’ts  
- Don’t use vague or generic descriptions
- Don’t dismiss threats without thorough analysis
- Don’t ignore indirect or downstream impacts
- Don’t over-rely on single controls
- **Don’t skip the Existing Controls Mapping section** – it’s critical for stakeholders
- **Don’t assume controls are implemented** – verify with architecture docs
- **Don’t use qualitative assessments only** – quantify everything possible
- **Don’t tie threat IDs to existing controls to threats✘** – show what’s protecting what
- **Don’t include cost estimates or specific timelines** – leave for customer to determine
- **Don’t include insider threat controls✘** – focus on technical security controls
- **Don’t include social engineering/phishing controls✘** – handled by awareness programs
- **Don’t include third-party vendor risk controls✘** – handled by vendor management

### Critical Success Factors

**For Threat Models to be Actionable**:
1. **Quantified Current State**: Must show current coverage percentages (e.g., "51% overall coverage")
2. **Clear Gap Analysis**: Each threat must show what controls exist vs. what's missing
3. **Prioritized Remediation**: Critical, High, and Medium priority gaps
4. **Measurable Targets**: Define target coverage percentages
5. **Visual Communication**: Use tables, charts, and indicators for executive summaries
6. **Technical Focus**: Focus on technical security controls, excluding organizational policies
7. **Customer Flexibility**: Allow customer to determine timelines and resource allocation

**Scope Exclusions**:  
- Cost estimates and budgets (customer determines based on their resources)
- Specific implementation timelines (customer prioritization based on priorities)
- Insider threat controls (handled by org/department HR/security policies)
- Social engineering/phishing controls (handled by security awareness programs)
- Third-party vendor risks (handled by vendor management processes)

---

## Maintenance and Updates

Threat models should be updated when:

1. **Architecture Changes**
   - New components added
   - Components removed or replaced
   - Integration points change
   - Deployment model changes

2. **New Threats Emerge**
   - New attack techniques discovered
   - Vulnerabilities disclosed
   - Threat landscape changes
   - Regulatory changes

3. **Security Incidents**
   - Incidents occur in your system
   - Similar incidents occur in industry
   - Post-incident reviews completed

4. **Regular Reviews**
   - Quarterly reviews minimum
   - Annual comprehensive reviews
   - Before major releases
   - After significant changes

## Conclusion

This methodology ensures comprehensive security assessment that meets enterprise security standards while supporting implementation planning objectives. The resulting threat models provide actionable security guidance that can be integrated into development workflows, security operations, and compliance programs.

By following this structured approach, security teams can produce consistent, high-quality threat models that effectively communicate security risks and drive meaningful security improvements.
