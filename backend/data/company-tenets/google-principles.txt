Google's Evaluation Principles and Cultural Values

Google evaluates candidates, including interns, based on a combination of technical excellence, "Googleyness," and alignment with company values. These principles guide how Google assesses fit and potential.

Core Principles:

1. Focus on the User
Everything we do starts with the user. We build products that people love and that make their lives better. User experience is paramount.

For interns: Demonstrate user-centric design, usability testing, understanding of user needs, and focus on creating delightful experiences.

2. Think 10x, Not 10%
We aim for breakthrough innovations, not incremental improvements. We encourage moonshot thinking and ambitious goals that can change the world.

For interns: Show ambitious projects, innovative thinking, willingness to tackle big problems, and creative solutions that go beyond obvious approaches.

3. Bet on Technical Insights
We believe that technical innovation is the foundation of great products. Deep technical understanding leads to breakthrough solutions.

For interns: Demonstrate strong technical fundamentals, deep understanding of computer science concepts, algorithmic thinking, and ability to apply technical knowledge creatively.

4. Ship and Iterate
We launch products and learn from real-world usage. We believe in getting things out there, gathering feedback, and continuously improving.

For interns: Show completed projects, iterative development, incorporating feedback, and comfort with launching and learning.

5. Give Users What They Want Before They Know They Want It
We anticipate user needs and build products that solve problems users didn't know they had.

For interns: Demonstrate innovative thinking, understanding of user behavior, predictive problem-solving, and ability to identify unmet needs.

6. Be Data-Driven
We make decisions based on data and evidence, not opinions or intuition. We measure everything and let the data guide us.

For interns: Show use of analytics, A/B testing, metrics-driven development, and ability to analyze and interpret data to inform decisions.

7. Collaborate and Innovate
Great ideas come from collaboration. We work together across teams and disciplines to build the best solutions.

For interns: Demonstrate teamwork, cross-functional collaboration, open communication, and ability to work effectively with diverse teams.

8. Aim for Simplicity
We strive to make complex things simple and accessible. The best solutions are often the simplest ones.

For interns: Show ability to simplify complex problems, clean code, intuitive interfaces, and focus on essential features over feature bloat.
